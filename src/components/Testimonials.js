                                            Here you should write some nice things that someone has said about you.
                                            No lies though, employers can tell when you are lying.

                                            That Iosif Dobos must be one of the most brilliant developers I've ever met!
                                            It is amazing that nobody has hired him yet. Hey you, you should hire this guy,
                                            he may be fresh out of University and have zero on the job experience but I am
                                            confident that he will be one of your best developers in no time!

                                            Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is
                                            to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.
                                            If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart,
                                            you'll know when you find it.
